# My Portfolio 

## Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio 

For this challenge, I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added onto throughout the bootcamp course. This portfolio will eventually become my own personal portfolio of work. 

I kept the following requirements in mind while writing the HTML and CSS: 

* Header with title and navigation links at the top of the page that will take you to different sections of the page which includes the About Me, Work, and Contact Me sections. 
* Link to a current copy of my resume 
* Included a recent photo of myself along with my favorite quote 
* Included a color palette that was used throughout the page to have cohesive look 
* Links all have hover effects that distinguishes it as a link 
* The page was also styled for multiple screen sizes 

## About Me Section 
This section has placeholder text where I will place more detailed text about myself. 

## Work Section 
This section has various images that displays the projects that I will complete in this bootcamp. Currently there are placeholder images for each project and each image is linked to each project. 

## Contact Me Section 
This section has my contact information which includes my phone number, email, GitHub page, and Linkedin page.
